\section{Program Notes}

This is an improvised, from-scratch live coding performance. The NIME
interface which this performance showcases is the new Feedfoward
editor for the TidalCycles live coding environment. Feedforward is
written in Haskell using the ncurses library for terminal-based user
interfaces. It runs on low-powered hardware including the Raspberry Pi
Zero, with formative testing of prototypes conducted with several
groups of children between the ages of 8 and 14.

Feedforward has a number of features designed to support improvised,
multi-pattern live coding. Individual Tidal patterns are addressable
with hotkeys for fast mute and unmuting. Each pattern has a stereo VU
meter, to aid the quick matching of sound to pattern within a mix.

In addition, TidalCycles has been extended to store context with each
event, so that source code positions in its polyrhythmic sequence
mini-notation are tracked. This allows steps to be highlighted in the
source code whenever they are active. This works even when Tidal
combinators have been applied to manipulate the timeline. Formal
evaluation has yet to take place, but this feature appears to support
learning of how pattern manipulations work in Tidal.

Feedforward and TidalCycles is free/open source software under a GPL
licence version 3.0.

\section{PERFORMANCE NOTES}

Space: The performance would work best as an algorave-style club
performance, but could also work in a concert setting.

Technical requirements: Projection to rear of stage, with HDMI cable
to laptop on stage. Full-range, stereo PA, with on stage stereo
monitoring. Venue provides stereo pair of XLR cables from my Radial
USB DI.

Performers: Solo laptop musician

Feasibility: I have improvised hundreds of from-scratch live coded
performances over the past 17 years. I have performed with this new
editor feedforward several times including a live streamed performance
watched by tens of thousands of people.
